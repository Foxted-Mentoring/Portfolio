                    <h3>Audience</h3>
                    <p>The United Nations, the Government of Canada, university scholars,and the general public.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mandate</h3>
                    <p>To provide academic resources to hold the Canadian government accountable for their promises to improve the status of women in Canada.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Old Website</h3>
                    <p>The original website was cluttered with information and information was not logically grouped to make things easy to find.</p>
                    <p>The website was also not responsive for mobile devices.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>New Website</h3>
                    <p>The new website only contains essential information. The most important goal
                        was to get donations, so the "Donate" button is repeated in bright yellow at the top and bottom of
                        every page. The secondary goal was to educate and serve as a resource to academic scholars and to educate the public.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
                    <p>The new website is a custom-made Wordpress website that is responsive as well as multi-lingual
                        (English & French), using the Wordpress Multilingual extension.</p>
                    <p>The design was created as a 2D mockup in Photoshop, then brought to life using Bootstrap 3.</p>
                </li>
