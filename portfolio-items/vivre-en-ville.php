            <p>City of Quebec municipal government, schools and residents of the city.</p></li>

            <h3>Mandate</h3>
            <p>To redesign a new logo and stationery materials for Vivre en Ville, a provincially funded, non-profit organization in Quebec City that promotes education and public awareness of the importance of practicing green and sustainable living.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Restrictions</h3>
            <p>Not to exceed the 2-colour limitation.</p>
        </li>

            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>I wanted to convey the concept of a rooftop garden in their new logo, since rooftop gardens are one of the organization's mandates. So I drew the image by hand on paper, then scanned and digitally redrew the plant-like letterforms in Illustrator.</p>
            <p>The vertical rectangular forms represent buildings, and are in stark contrast to the organic, free-flowing forms of the plants.</p>
            <p>Thin, vertical and horizontal bars were used to convey modernism through a minimalistic design aesthetic.</p>
