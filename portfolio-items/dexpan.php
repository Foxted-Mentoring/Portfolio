            <h3>Old Website</h3>
            <p>The original website was cluttered with information and was not logically grouped for information to be easily found.</p>
            <p>Not responsive for mobile devices. Click here to <a href="http://jolly-joey-05.gopagoda.com">view the
                    old website</a>.</p>

            <h3>New Website</h3>
            <p>The new website strips away all unnecessary elements, leaving the essentials. The most important goal
                was to get donations, so the "Donate" button is repeated in bright yellow at the top and bottom of
                every page.</p>
            <p>The new website is a custom-made Wordpress website that is responsive as well as multi-lingual
                (English & French).</p>
            <p>The design was built from scratch with 2D mockups in Photoshop, then brought to life using Bootstrap.</p>
