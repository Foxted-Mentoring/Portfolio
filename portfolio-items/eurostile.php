                    <h3>Audience</h3>
                    <p>The United Nations, university scholars, and the general public.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mandate</h3>
                    <p>To provide academic resources to hold the government accountable for their promises to improve the situation for women in Canada.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Old Website</h3>
                    <p>The original website was cluttered with information and was not logically grouped for information to be easily found.</p>
                    <p>Not responsive for mobile devices.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>New Website</h3>
                    <p>The new website strips away all unnecessary elements, leaving the essentials. The most important goal
                        was to get donations, so the "Donate" button is repeated in bright yellow at the top and bottom of
                        every page.</p>
                    <p>The new website is a custom-made Wordpress website that is responsive as well as multi-lingual
                        (English & French).</p>
                    <p>The design was built from scratch with 2D mockups in Photoshop, then brought to life using Bootstrap.</p>
                </li>
