            <h3>Mandate</h3>
            <p>To write and design an educational booklet on the Eurostile font: its creator, including a short biography about the typographer, the source of inspiration to create the font, its uses and applications, and evolution of the type.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>After researching and writing a short text about the Eurostile font, its evolution, uses and its typographer, I decided to create this booklet in the same shape that inspired its creator, Aldo Novarese.</p>
            <h4>Concept</h4>
            <p>Back in the 1950's, TV sets and airplane windows were shaped as squares with rounded corners, inspiring Novarese to reflect this in his typography, with the letter "O" illustrating best this characteristic.</p>
            <h4>Typographic Patterns & Exploration</h4>
            <p>I formed different patterns using the letters of the typography to serve as decorative backgrounds, and with no page ever to repeat exactly the same pattern.</p>
            <p>To make a relatively dry subject interesting, I kept the text as short and concise as possible, using lots of visuals to compliment and support the messages.</p>
            <h4>Breaking Boundaries</h4>
            <p>To get around the 2-colour limit, I used different colour blends of only two hues: lime green and navy, to yield a whole gamut ofÂ new colours.</p>
            <h4>End Product</h4>
            <p>The end result is a booklet that takes the reader on a process of discovery, while making the experience fun, flippant, and an enjoyable read.</p>
